You can test it on my [live demo].

## Features

  - A modern/user-friendly mobile/desktop audio visualizer built using CanvasJS.
  - Responsive design allows for ease of usage from both desktop and mobile access.

## Planned Features
  - Integrate a customizable theme which users can select based off their own personal style.
  - Customizable visualizer settings to give the user rmore control on the visuals based on the mood of the audio.

## Personal Insight
> The Audio Visualizer is a personal achievement of mine because I was able to build my CanvasJS skill-set to create a modern feel. 
> Having experience with .mp3 storage and loading, I was able to implement those skills to create the Audio Visualizer with local loading of .mp3 files to give the user more flexibility.
> After fully implementing all front-end features, I made a few changes to make the user experience smoother.
